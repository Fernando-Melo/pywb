**pywb** is a Python (2 and 3) web archive replay and recording toolkit.

This toolset forms the foundation of Webrecorder, but also provides a variety of web archiving tools,
such as the traditional "Wayback Machine" functionality.

Note: this version, which represents a major overhaul of pywb, is not yet released on pypi, but you can:

* Install with ``python setup.py install``

* Run tests with ``python setup.py test``

* Run Wayback with ``wayback`` (see docs for info on how to setup collections)

* Build docs locally with:  ``cd docs; make html``

* ..and a lot more!

Please see the `Webrecorder pywb documentation for usage and configuration info <https://pywb.readthedocs.org>`_
